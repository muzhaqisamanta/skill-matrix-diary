`08/06ðŸ˜ª`

Yesterday we planned on expanding the backoffice-app but we had some issues with the form-app so we focused on solving them. 
The issues appeared when we changed the database tables with some new columns, 
we had problems with updating the seeds but we managed to fix it. 
Today we also added new validations for the survey invitations and also what happens when the user submits the survey.

I think we ended this week well ðŸ˜„

During the weekend we fixed what was left with the form-app and this morning we did the final thing, 
we added a dialog after the submit to display a message if the submit was successful or not.
Planning on expanding the backoffice-app...
