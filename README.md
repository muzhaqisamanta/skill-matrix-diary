Since the form app frontend part is finished, today I started with the backoffice. 
Added a welcome page, header and footer. 
Today we plan on expanding the backoffice app with backend to create boards and surveys and also doing more on frontend part. 
```

## DAY-5
`08/06😪`
```
Yesterday we planned on expanding the backoffice-app but we had some issues with the form-app so we focused on solving them. 
The issues appeared when we changed the database tables with some new columns, we had problems with updating the seeds but we managed to fix it. 
Today we also added new validations for the survey invitations and also what happens when the user submits the survey.

I think we ended this week well 😄
